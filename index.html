      <h2>Experience!</h2>
      <p>
        I have experience in using html from my pre-established CIS174 web
        development class where i formatted website and hosted them online via
        online hosting service seperate from github. discerning between
        percentages and pixels the use of tables and floats, as well as
        formatting the used colors and fonts are all skills i'm glad to have
        experience using for use on this very page.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently Formatting and maintaining an html file via referenced
        external stylesheet or CSS file;
      </p>
      <h3>Css Knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        CSS and coding without making serious mistakes requires a serious amount
        of attention to detail and commitment so it's often i come across
        something that changes what being serious can look like; like the
        command git commit for instance; it's modifier makes a serious
        difference. git push and git pull are very important to the cohesion of
        your workflow while coding. I, from experience, know there are alot of
        places where errors in your workflow can arise if you aren't careful and
        pay attention, you will have to pay with time.
