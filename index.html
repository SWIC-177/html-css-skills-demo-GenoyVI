      #<h2>Experience!</h2>

      <p>I have experience in using html from my pre-established CIS174
        web development class where i formatted website and hosted them online
        via online hosting service seperate from github. discerningn between percentages and pixels
        the use of tables and floats, as well as formatting the used colors and fonts are all skills
        i'm glad to have experience using for use on this very page.
      </p>

      <p>I'm currently Formatting and maintaining an html file via referenced
        external stylesheet or CSS file;
      </p>
        #<h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>  I like DnB music, 3d art, and game design (supermonkeyball)
          i'm a big marine-biology nerd and i'm a big talk your ear off vegan(don't come near me, i'm warning you)
          <p>CSS and coding without making serious mistakes requires a serious amount of
            attention to detail and commitment so it's often i come across something that changes what being serious can look like;
          like the command git commit for instance; it's modifier makes a serious difference</p>
